ENABLED=1
# Options
# See man spamd for possible options. The -d option is automatically added.

# NOTE: version 3.0.x has switched to a "preforking" model, so you
# need to make sure --max-children is not set to anything higher than
# 5, unless you know what you're doing.

OPTIONS="--create-prefs --max-children 5 --username spamd --helper-home-dir /var/lib/spamassassin/"

# Pid file
# Where should spamd write its PID to file? If you use the -u or
# --username option above, this needs to be writable by that user.
# Otherwise, the init script will not be able to shut spamd down.
PIDFILE="/var/run/spamd.pid"

# Set nice level of spamd
#NICE="--nicelevel 15"
