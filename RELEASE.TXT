it.


2013/09/10 5.0.5
Group-Office 5.0 was completely redesigned. It was time to modernize the

The invitation system has been greatly improved. Now events are scheduled directly
into the users' calendars and the status of the event is directly visual. This
provides a much better user experience. The calendar group view and file manager

It's important to know that:

2012/04/11 4.0.1
This is a beta release for the upcoming 4.0 version. It is not intended for 
production use. Please just use it for testing and provide us feedback in the 
forum. 
We completely rewrote the PHP framework using the MVC approach. On the interface 
it may seem like there are not so many changes but under the hood there's a shiny 
new engine! This get's us ready for the future. It will enable us to create a
 mobile interface for example. It's also a much more organized and more secure 
framework. Extensive security testing has been performed by Cigitel.
There's also a new module for document management. You can search through files 
and add workflow to documents.

Important:

If you use SyncML clients like funambol you must reconfigure them. When you use
the debian repository you must connect to /sync instead of /sync.php. If you
don't use Debian packages you can connect to /modules/syncml/index.php.
Also make sure the syncml module is installed.


10/03/2011 3.7.1
This release has a lot of enhancements under the hood. Everything has been
optimized to work well in very large environments such as more then 20.000 users.
There are also some interesting new features such as Sieve mail filtering
support, Public icalendar files for calendars, Shared IMAP accounts and better
LDAP authentication connectivity.


2010/12/01 3.6.4
This release focuses on interoperability with other systems. With WebDAV and
CalDAV support the filesystem can be mounted like a network drive and you can
access the calender data directly with a calendar application. It also supports
meeting requests from other calendar applications now.
We moved the HTML templates, addresslists and newsletters into the community
version as we think these features belong to the community version.
There are lots of other changes too, checkout the full changelog that's included
with the package.

2010/05/14 3.5.1
We wrote a new fast IMAP library that doesn't require the php imap extension
which could be very slow with remote IMAP servers. POP-3 support is no longer
supported by the library because it's doesn't make much sense to use POP-3 with
webmail anyway.
The startup time of Group-Office has been improved, there is support for
Microsoft Office templates now and we improved the ticket system a lot.
Customers can also login through the Group-Office interface now.

2009/02/24 3.4.0
In this release we bring you a lot of small improvements across all modules and
also Microsoft ActiveSync support so you can sync with any phone that supports
ActiveSync. This means you can sync with iPhones, Nokia's, Google Android and
of course Windows Mobile. Setting up synchronization with contacts,
appointments, tasks and e-mail is really easy now!
We also improved the link browser and management of newsletters a lot. With the
new advanced search in the addressbook you can select any dataset from the
addressbook and save that search.
Check out the changelog for a full list of changes.

2009/12/01 3.3.0
We've been working a lot on performance for this release. We're now using
compression on the files so the startup time of Group-Office is much faster.

on large installations.

2008/11/24 Version 3.00 stable

After more then one and a half year of development time and testing it's finally there! 
We are proud to present Group-Office 3.0, Group-Office needed to be modernized. 
New web techniques have been developed and are ready to use in a professional platform 
such as Group-Office. We completely rewrote the interface of Group-Office. It feels much 
more like a desktop application now with drag and drop features, flexible information panels
and much more!
Besides the eye candy and usability enhancements a lot has been improved under the hood too. 
The database adapter has been rewritten to use the improved MySQLi extension for better security. 
Data sent to the database is checked for attacks at the lowest level so it's impossible for 
developers to write insecure database queries when they use the Group-Office framework. A lot 
more has been done to improve security like insecure image blocking  in the e-mail module. 
It's impossible to name every change here in this message, you should check out the 
new version for yourself!

2008/09/03 Version 3.00 unstable

It was time for Group-Office to modernise. New web techniques have been developed and 
are ready to use in a professional platform such as Group-Office. Techniques such as 
AJAX, PHP5 and MySQL5. We compared a lot of AJAX frameworks and we came to the 
conclusion that ExtJS was the best framework for Group-Office. We decided to completely
rewrite Group-Office with this framework and we are very proud with the result.
Group-Office looks better, works better and is ready for the future!
